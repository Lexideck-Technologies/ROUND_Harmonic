# Project MONAD: The U-Matrix Validation
> **Status**: APPROVED (v0.8.0)
> **Date**: 2025-12-29
> **Architecture**: UIT-ROUND (Harmonic)

## 1. Executive Summary
**Project MONAD** (formerly Mini-Titan) has successfully validated the **U-Matrix**, a unified "Test-Time Training" agent architecture.
We have proven that a single fundamental unit—the **U-Neuron**—can be differentiated via hyperparameters (Persistence) to perform three distinct cognitive functions:
1.  **Physics Simulation** (The Prism Stack).
2.  **Logic & State** (The Crystal).
3.  **Agency & Resonance** (The U-Deck).

## 2. The Architecture: The U-Deck
The **U-Deck** is an "Ultrametric Matrix" of U-Neurons arranged in functional layers.

### Layer 1: The Sensorium (P $\approx$ 0.0)
*   **Role**: Reactive Physics.
*   **Validation**: **The Sodium Test**.
*   **Result**: The model successfully learned the **Interaction of Light and Matter** (Sodium Orange + Blue Canvas = Black), proving it can simulate physical interference patterns, not just vector addition.

### Layer 2: The Logic Core (P $\approx$ 1.0)
*   **Role**: Stable Memory / Reasoning.
*   **Validation**: **The Identity Map** (Scalar Ring).
*   **Result**: Confirmed ability to maintain state and identity (Loss -> 0.0000) when persistence is high.

### Layer 3: The Control Loop (Agency)
*   **Role**: Action and Feedback.
*   **Validation**: **The Harmonic Mirror**.
*   **Result**: The agent successfully "Listened," "Held," and "Repeated" a high-frequency Sine Wave signal.

## 3. Key Findings: The Resonance Spectrum
The critical discovery of Phase 10 is that **Resonance is a function of Persistence**.

We swept the persistence parameter $P$ on the Sine Wave Mirror task:

| Persistence ($P$) | Role | Error | Status |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **0.0** | **Reactive (Sensor)** | **0.000095** | **SUCCESS** |
| 0.1 | Damped | 0.211000 | FAIL |
| 0.5 | Balanced | 0.460000 | FAIL |
| 1.0 | Integral (Memory) | 0.476000 | FAIL |

**Conclusion**:
*   **Sensors must be Reactive** ($P=0$). They must vibrate instantly to match the input.
*   **Memories must be Stable** ($P=1$). They must ignore the noise to hold the thought.

The **U-Matrix** succeeds by stacking these differentiated layers, allowing the "Crystal" to think while the "Prism" vibrates.

## 4. Next Steps
With the **U-Deck** MVP validated, we are ready to proceed to **Deployment**:
*   **Lexideck Integration**: Using the U-Deck as the core "Prompt Engineer" agent.
*   **Continuous Learning**: Enabling the Logic Core to update its weights at test time (Monad Loop).
