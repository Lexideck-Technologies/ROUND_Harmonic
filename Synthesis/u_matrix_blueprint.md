# The U-Matrix Blueprint (Project MONAD)

> **"From the Unit, the Universal."**

## 1. Vision: The Unified Matrix
The goal of **Project MONAD** is to construct the **U-Matrix** (Universal Matrix), a minimal viable "Agentic Logic" powered by the **U-Neuron** (UIT-ROUND).

Unlike traditional LLMs which separate "Memory" (KV Cache) from "Compute" (Weights), the U-Matrix unifies them into a single **Harmonic State**. This system demonstrates that a sufficiently advanced **U-Neuron** can simultaneously act as:
1.  **A Physics Engine** (Simulating light/matter interaction).
2.  **A Logic Gate** (Processing symbolic rules).
3.  **A Memory Unit** (Maintaining state over time).

## 2. The Fundamental Unit: The U-Neuron
The U-Neuron (based on UIT-ROUND "Harmonic" v0.8.0) is the "Monad" of the system.
*   **Geometry**: A Phasic Oscillator on the Complex Plane ($e^{i\theta}$).
*   **Dynamics**: Defined by the update rule $h_t = h_{t-1} + \Delta h$.
*   **Topology**: Inherently circular, protected from singularity by the "Phi Tail" (Scalar Phase).

### Differentiated Function
In the U-Matrix, U-Neurons are specialized not by architecture, but by **Frequency** and **Role**:
*   **The Crystal (State/Logic)**: High-persistence neurons that maintain symbolic state (ASCII/Logic).
*   **The Prism (Physics/Sensorium)**: Fluid, interactive neurons that simulate continuous dynamics (Light/Color).

## 3. The System: The U-Matrix Architecture
The U-Matrix is a composite structure formed by stacking U-Neurons into functional layers.

### Layer 1: The Sensorium (Physics Core)
*   **Role**: Perception and Physical Interaction.
*   **Mechanism**: The "Prism Stack" (validated in Phase 8).
*   **Input**: Raw signals (Spectral data, Pixel values).
*   **Output**: Harmonic State representation of the physical world.

### Layer 2: The Logic Core (Symbolic Crystal)
*   **Role**: Reasoning and State Managment.
*   **Mechanism**: The "Logic Crystal" (validated in Phase 7).
*   **Input**: Harmonic State from Layer 1.
*   **Function**: Applies transition rules ($State_t \to State_{t+1}$).

### Layer 3: The Control Loop (Agency)
*   **Role**: Action and Feedback.
*   **Mechanism**: A recurrent feedback loop connecting Layer 2 $\to$ Layer 1.
*   **Function**: Allows the system to "predict" the next sensory state or "act" to change it.

## 4. Implementation Strategy
We will implement the **`UMatrix`** class, a self-contained module wrapping these three layers.
*   **Codebase**: `UIT_ROUND` (v0.8.0).
*   **Validation Steps**:
    1.  **Unit Tests**: Re-verify Physics (Sodium) and Logic (Parity) within the Matrix class.
    2.  **Agent Test**: "The Harmonic Game" (Simple Agent-Environment Loop).
